## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

> **AI is the branch of computer science that aims to build machines that can perform tasks that require human intelligence.**

These tasks include:
- Understanding language (e.g., Siri, ChatGPT)
- Recognizing images (e.g., Face ID)
- Making decisions (e.g., self-driving cars)
- Learning from data (e.g., Netflix recommendations)

üìå **Important Terms**
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Subset of AI that uses data to train algorithms.
- **Deep Learning**: A kind of ML using neural networks (inspired by the brain).

## 2. History of AI

| Era | Key Events |
|-----|------------|
| **1950s** | Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test (1950) |
| **1956** | Term "Artificial Intelligence" coined at Dartmouth Conference |
| **1970s‚Äì80s** | AI Winters (funding dropped due to high expectations) |
| **1997** | IBM's Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov |
| **2011‚ÄìNow** | Siri, Alexa, Tesla, AlphaGo, ChatGPT revolutionize AI |

---

## 3. Why AI? (Motivations)

### üîπ Solves human limitations:
- Humans can‚Äôt process gigabytes of data in seconds ‚Äî AI can.
- Machines don't get tired or bored ‚Äî good for repetitive or dangerous tasks.

### üîπ Improves:
- Healthcare: Diagnosing diseases
- Transportation: Self-driving cars
- Finance: Fraud detection
- Education: Personalized learning

## 4. How AI Works

AI systems typically follow this cycle:

### üîÅ The AI Cycle:
1. **Perceive** input (e.g., image, sound, data)
2. **Understand/Interpret** using models
3. **Decide** the best action
4. **Act** (e.g., display result, move robot)

### üß† Key Techniques:
- **Search algorithms**: Used in games (chess, tic-tac-toe)
- **Knowledge representation**: How facts/rules are stored
- **Machine Learning**: Data-driven learning
- **Neural Networks**: Brain-like data processing (used in image recognition)

---

## 5. Turing Test

> The Turing Test is used to judge whether a machine‚Äôs behavior is indistinguishable from a human's.

### ü§ñ Setup:
- A human talks to both a machine and another human through a computer.
- If the human can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs who, the machine passes the test.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Misconceptions:
- Passing the Turing Test doesn‚Äôt mean the machine understands anything.
- It only shows **the machine can mimic** human responses.

### üîç Example:
ChatGPT might pass the Turing Test in casual conversation but still doesn‚Äôt "understand" like a human.

## 6. Agents and Environments

### What is an Agent?
> An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment and take actions to reach goals.

### What is an Environment?
> The **environment** is everything outside the agent ‚Äî it provides input and reacts to actions.

### üîÑ Perception-Action Loop:

### Examples:
| Agent | Environment | Sensors | Actuators |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Robot vacuum | Room | Dirt sensor | Wheels, suction |
| Self-driving car | Road | Camera, GPS | Steering, brakes |

## 7. Types of Agents

1. **Simple Reflex Agent**
   - Uses *condition-action* rules
   - Example: Motion sensor turns light ON when it detects movement

2. **Model-Based Reflex Agent**
   - Has internal memory to keep track of unseen parts of the environment

3. **Goal-Based Agent**
   - Chooses actions to reach a specific goal
   - Example: GPS navigation app

4. **Utility-Based Agent**
   - Chooses actions based on the best outcome (utility)
   - Example: Investment AI maximizing profit

5. **Learning Agent**
   - Improves over time using feedback and experience
   - Example: Self-driving car learning from past routes

---

## 8. Agent Architectures

> Architecture is the internal structure of the agent: how it processes input and chooses output.

### üß± Architectures:
- **Simple reflex**: Rule-based
- **Model-based reflex**: Rule + memory
- **Goal-based**: Planning
- **Utility-based**: Optimization
- **Learning agent**: Learns from mistakes

### üì¶ Components of a Learning Agent:
- **Learning element**: Improves performance
- **Performance element**: Chooses actions
- **Critic**: Evaluates results
- **Problem generator**: Suggests new experiences

---

## 9. PEAS Representation

> PEAS = Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors  
It helps define AI **task environments**.

### üßπ Example: Vacuum Cleaner

| PEAS Element | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Cleanliness, battery efficiency |
| **Environment** | Floors, walls, dirt |
| **Actuators** | Wheels, suction |
| **Sensors** | Dirt sensor, bump sensor |

### üöò Example: Self-Driving Car

| PEAS Element | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Safety, speed, comfort |
| **Environment** | Roads, traffic, weather |
| **Actuators** | Steering, brakes, throttle |
| **Sensors** | Camera, radar, GPS |

## 10. Foundations of AI

AI is built on these major fields:

| Discipline | Contributions |
|------------|---------------|
| **Philosophy** | Logic, reasoning, ethics |
| **Mathematics** | Statistics, probability, linear algebra |
| **Psychology** | Human learning and cognition |
| **Computer Science** | Programming, data structures |
| **Neuroscience** | Brain modeling (inspired neural networks) |
| **Linguistics** | Natural language processing |
| **Economics** | Decision making, utility theory |

## 11. AI vs Human Intelligence

| Feature | AI | Human |
|--------|----|--------|
| Speed | Very fast | Moderate |
| Emotions | None | Present |
| Creativity | Limited | Natural |
| Learning | From data | From experience & reasoning |
| Adaptability | Domain-specific | Cross-domain |
| Energy use | High | Low |
