## üß† 1. What is an AI Agent?

**Definition:**

> An agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators.

**Agent Loop:**

```
Perceive ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Repeat
```

**Examples:**

| Agent            | Sensors        | Actuators        | Environment         |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Self-driving car | LIDAR, cameras | Steering, brakes | Road                |
| Chatbot          | Text input     | Text output      | Online conversation |
| Cleaning robot   | Dust sensor    | Wheels, vacuum   | Room                |

**PEAS = Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors**

**Example: Chatbot**

| PEAS | Description             |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| P    | Response time, accuracy |
| E    | User input (text)       |

---

## üß© 7. Types of Agents

### 7.1 Simple Reflex Agent

* No memory, uses condition-action rules

```python
if percept == "obstacle":
    action = "turn"
```

**Use Case:** Thermostat, Basic bots

### 7.2 Model-Based Reflex Agent

* Maintains internal state

```python
model = {}
def agent(percept):
    model.update(percept)
    return decide(model)
```

**Use Case:** Roomba

### 7.3 Goal-Based Agent

* Uses search/planning to achieve a goal

```python
if location == goal:
    return "stop"
else:
    return "move"
```

**Use Case:** Google Maps

### 7.4 Utility-Based Agent

* Chooses action using utility function

```python
def choose_action(actions):
    return max(actions, key=utility)
```

**Use Case:** Netflix, YouTube

### 7.5 Learning Agent

| Component                      | Role                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Learning Element               | Improves agent       |
| Performance Element            | Executes actions     |
| Critic                         | Gives feedback       |
| Problem Generator              | Suggests new actions |
