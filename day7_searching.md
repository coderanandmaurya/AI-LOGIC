# Part 7 – Local Search & Advanced Strategies

---

## 🔹 Why Local Search?

* Classical search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A\*, Minimax) → **systematic search**.
* Problem: They need **huge memory & time** for large state spaces.
* Local search:

  * Works with **a single current state** (not paths).
  * Moves incrementally to **neighboring states**.
  * Useful when:

    * State space is **large or infinite**.
    * **Path** to solution doesn’t matter → only final state matters.

---

## 🔹 Characteristics of Local Search

1. Uses **constant memory**.
2. Can find **good solutions quickly**, not guaranteed optimal.
3. Useful for **optimization problems** (e.g., scheduling, resource allocation).
4. Often **stochastic** → may use randomness.
5. Works well when we just want **“a good enough” solution**.

---

## 🔹 Hill Climbing

* **Greedy approach**: always move to neighbor with higher value (better heuristic).
* Analogy: **Climbing a hill** – always step uphill until no more progress.

### Types:

1. **Simple hill climbing** → choose first better neighbor.
2. **Steepest-ascent hill climbing** → choose best among all neighbors.
3. **Stochastic hill climbing** → choose random better neighbor.

### Problems:

* **Local maxima** → stuck in a peak that isn’t global.
* **Plateaus** → flat area with no improvement.
* **Ridges** → need to move in different directions, not just one.

---

## 🔹 Simulated Annealing

* Inspired by **metallurgy annealing** (cooling metals slowly).
* Randomized search that sometimes **accepts worse moves** to escape local maxima.
* Probability of accepting worse move decreases over time (temperature ↓).

### Algorithm idea:

1. Start with random state & high temperature.
2. Pick a random neighbor.
3. If better → move.
4. If worse → move with probability `e^(-ΔE/T)`.
5. Gradually decrease temperature (cooling schedule).

### Advantages:

* Escapes local maxima.
* Can find global optimum with enough time.

---

## 🔹 Local Beam Search

* Instead of 1 state, keep **k states**.
* At each step, generate successors of all k states.
* Select the best k among them.
* Encourages exploration, avoids local traps better than hill climbing.

---

## 🔹 Genetic Algorithms

* Inspired by **biological evolution**.
* Works with a **population of states**.
* Operations:

  1. **Selection** → pick best candidates.
  2. **Crossover** → combine features of parents.
  3. **Mutation** → randomly alter a candidate.
* Repeat until solution found.

### Example:

* Scheduling problem → chromosomes represent schedules.
* Fitness function = how good schedule is.

---

## 🔹 Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)

* Many AI tasks are **CSPs** → must satisfy constraints.
* Examples:

  * Map coloring (no two adjacent same color).
  * Sudoku (digits must be unique in row, column, block).
  * Timetabling (no conflicts).

### CSP Formulation

* **Variables** → X1, X2, …
* **Domains** → possible values.
* **Constraints** → rules.
* Goal → assignment satisfying all constraints.

### CSP Search

* Standard search too slow → exponential.
* Use **backtracking with heuristics**:

  * **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)** → choose variable with fewest options.
  * **Degree heuristic** → choose variable that constrains most others.
  * **Least constraining value** → pick value that rules out fewest choices.

### Local Search for CSPs

* **Min-conflicts heuristic**:

  * Assign random values.
  * Repeatedly change value of variable that conflicts with constraints.
  * Works well for large CSPs (e.g., scheduling).

---

## 🔹 Example CSP – Map Coloring

* Variables → regions.
* Domains → {Red, Blue, Green}.
* Constraint → neighbors ≠ same color.
* Solved using backtracking + heuristics.

---

## 🔹 Applications of Local Search & CSP

1. **Scheduling** → airline flights, university exams.
2. **Resource allocation** → factories, networks.
3. **Circuit design** → placing components efficiently.
4. **Robotics** → motion planning.
5. **Games** → puzzles like Sudoku, crosswords.

---

## 🔹 Class Activities

1. Solve a **4-region map coloring CSP** in class.
2. Show **hill climbing stuck at local maxima**.
3. Run a **simulated annealing demo** with temperature decreasing.
4. Solve a **Sudoku puzzle using CSP heuristics**.

---

## 🔹 Summary

* Local search → works with states, not paths.
* Hill climbing → greedy, can get stuck.
* Simulated annealing → uses randomness to escape local maxima.
* Local beam search → explores multiple states.
* Genetic algorithms → inspired by evolution.
* CSPs → formal way to solve problems with constraints.
* Many **real-world applications** rely on these strategies.
